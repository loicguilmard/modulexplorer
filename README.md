## Usage
This is not working running the file.
It doesn't handle multiple environement.
This project goal is to compare the path of the object in PyMoDAQ v4 and v5 which you can't install in the same env.
So you need to create 2 environements. Launch the script in each env to create the 2 pickles for each version.
merge the files and load the result in the second part of the script.
